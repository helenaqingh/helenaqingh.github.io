        TaKumārajīva Temple in  <strong>Wuwei, China</strong>, The Kumārajīva Temple (Jiumoluoshi Temple) was first built during the Later Liang period (about 1,600 years ago). Kumārajīva was the first person in the history of Chinese Buddhism to systematically and deeply disseminate Buddhist scriptures using the Chinese language. If you would like to learn more about him, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGAcMwGSepI" target="_blank">this documentary</a>.

      <p class="photo-desc">
        The Grottoes of Jinta Temple in <strong>Zhangye, China</strong>, The Jinta Temple Grottoes (Jinta Temple Stone Caves) were carved during China's Northern Liang period (about 1,600 years ago). They are considered one of the prime examples of Northern Liang grottoes in China and are famous for their relatively well-preserved flying apsara statues (Feitian sculptures). To reach Jinta Temple, you need to climb the towering steps, one by one, at an altitude of approximately 3,000 meters (about 9,842 feet), but the effort is completely worthwhile. I highly recommend Jinta Temple to anyone interested in Buddhist culture, Chinese culture, or grotto art.
